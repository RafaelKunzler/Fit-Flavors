# 🍽️ [Fit Flavors](https://fit-flavors.vercel.app)

A simple and friendly recipe creation and storage website where users can add, organize and view healthy recipes. Built so that anyone (including me 😉) can save tasty ideas and build a personal digital cookbook.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Next.js`
- `React`
- `JavaScript`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Database Integration`
- `Vercel` (Deployment)

## 🚀 Features

- **Recipe Creation Form** – Add recipes with title, ingredients, and instructions
- **Recipe Storage** – Persist recipes using database integration
- **Clean Card Layout** – Organized and readable recipe display
- **Responsive Design** – Works across desktop and mobile
- **Simple & Intuitive UX** – Focused on usability and clarity

## 📍 The Process

I built Fit Flavors to practice working with forms, state management, and data persistence in a real-world scenario. Instead of building something purely visual, I wanted a project that actually solves a small everyday problem: organizing recipes.

The challenge was structuring the data properly and ensuring the interface stayed clean and easy to use. I focused on clarity over complexity. Simple components, clear layout, and functional database integration.

It’s the kind of project that shows I can handle both UI and data flow in a practical application.

## 🧩 Application Structure

- **Recipe Form Component** – Handles user input and validation
- **Recipe List Component** – Displays stored recipes dynamically
- **Database Layer** – Manages data persistence
- **UI Components** – Reusable layout and styling with Tailwind
